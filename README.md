# Web Development and Python Fundamentals Showcase

This repository is a curated collection of projects and code examples demonstrating foundational skills in web development and Python programming. It includes practical examples of HTML structure, modern CSS layouts like Flexbox and Grid, a complete Twitter UI clone, core Python concepts from basic syntax to Object-Oriented Programming, and a functional REST API built with FastAPI.

## Features

-   **Frontend Development**: Practical examples of modern CSS including Flexbox, Grid, animations, and responsive design, culminating in a visually accurate Twitter UI clone.
-   **Python Fundamentals**: A comprehensive set of scripts covering Python's core concepts, including data structures, control flow, functions, error handling, and OOP.
-   **Backend API**: A complete, documented RESTful API for a Todo application built with the high-performance FastAPI framework.

## Technologies Used

## Usage and Project Spotlights

This repository is structured into distinct sections. You can explore each part individually to see different skills in action.

### 1. Frontend Examples (HTML/CSS)

The `html/` and `css/` directories contain a series of files that demonstrate key web development concepts.

#### Twitter UI Clone

A static clone of the Twitter (X) user interface, built with HTML and CSS.

**To view this project:**
Open the `css/twitter-clone/index.html` file in your web browser.

#### CSS Concepts

Explore individual files to see demonstrations of:
-   **Flexbox Layout**: `css/2-flex.html`
-   **Grid Layout & Use-Case**: `css/4-grid.html`, `css/5-grid-use-case.html`
-   **Animations**: `css/3-animations.html`
-   **Responsive Design**: `css/9-responsive-design.html`

### 2. Python Core Concepts

The `python/` directory contains numerous scripts, each focusing on a specific Python feature. You can run them directly from your terminal.

**Example:**
```bash
python python/17_oop.py
```

### 3. Todo API (FastAPI Backend)

The `fastapi/` directory contains a fully functional REST API. The following section provides detailed documentation for its setup and endpoints.

# Todo API

## Overview
This is a RESTful API for managing a simple todo list. It is built with Python using the FastAPI framework for high performance and automatic documentation generation.

## Features
- **FastAPI**: Used for building the robust and asynchronous API endpoints.
- **Pydantic**: Handles data validation and serialization to ensure type safety.

## Getting Started
### Installation
1.  Navigate to the API's directory:
    ```bash
    cd fastapi
    ```
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install "fastapi[all]"
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
